## FlowMap
* Assumptions
	* Map to *K*-input LUTs
	* Input Boolean network is *K*-bounded (each node has fanin <= *K*)
	* *Unit delay* model
* *Labeling*: Compute a label for each node, that reflects the level of the *K*-LUT implementing that node in an
optimal mapping solution
* *Matching*: Generate the *K*-LUT mapping solution based on the node labels.

## Delay Model of FolwMap
* *Unit delay model*
	* No gate delay.
	* No interconnect delay within a cluster.
	* Delay *D* = 1 between two clusters.
* Delay minimization is equivalent to depth minimization under unit delay nodel

## Labeling Phase of FlowMap
* Labeling Phase
	* Process thenodes in *topological order*.
	* label(*v*) =  depth of the optimal *K*-LUT mapping solution for node *v*.
* Lemma 1: label(*v*) = *p* or *p*+1, where *p* is the maximum label of the input nodes of *v*. (Why?)
* Computation of label(*v*):
	* Check if there is a *K*-feasible cut (*X,Y*) in *N_v* of height *p*-1
	* If yes, label(*v*)=*p*, *Y* and *v* are pushed into the same K-LUT
	* Else, label(*v*)=*p*+1, use a new *K*-LUT for node *v*i.
* Question: How to determine if there is a *K*-feasible cut of height *p*-1 in *N_v*? <br>
(Hint: You can use the *network flow* method.) <br>
* What is the time complexity of this method?
	* Ans. O(mK)

## Example
(a) Original network and labels of nodes in *N_t*
(b) Transform into flow network
(c) Collapse nodes with largest labels, compute 3-feasible cut
(d) Get label(*t*) and LUT(*t*)

## Time Complexity of Labeling Phase
* Label of all the nodes in the subject tree can be computed in O(*Kmn*) time where *n* = no. of nodes and *m* = no. of edges. Since *m* = O(*n*)
for any *K*-bounded input network, the time complexity is O(*n*^2)

## Mapping Phase of FlowMap
1. *S* = Set of primary output nodes
2. Choose any *t* **BELONGS TO** *S*
3. Use *K*-LUT(*t*) as one of the *K*-LUTs.
4. Delete *t* from *S*.
5. Add *input*(*K*-LUT(*t*)) to *S*.
6. Goto step 2.

## FlowMap Complexity
1. Labeling phase takes O(*Kmn*) time.
2. Mapping phase takes O(*n*) time.
3. Hence, the total time complexity is O(*Kmn*), i.e., O(*n*^2)

## Minimization of #LUTs in FlowMap
* In the Labeling Phase, we use the network flow method to obtain min-cuts.
* Should we take the *min-area min-cut* of the *max-area min-cut* in order to reduece the total no. of
LUTs used?
* How to obtain a max-area min-cut?
* In order to reduce the total no. of LUTs used, we may maximize the cut volume during labeling phase.
* For each node, if min-cut size <= *K*
	* Find a max-area min-cut
	* Increase the volumen of the cut until the node-cut size exceeds *K*.
	* Use the last *K*-feasible cut as the solution.

## Post-Processing for Area Reduction
* Gate decomposition
* Flow pack

## DAOmap: optimal depth mapping with area optimization
* In a solution of FlowMap, many nodes have extra *slack*.
* For node with slack
	* Pick a cut with *minimum area cost* s.t. timeing increase does not exceed the slack
* For node with no slack
	* Among all cuts with *minimum timing cost*, pick one with *minimum area cost*
* Discourage unnecessary logic duplication.
* Re-run mapping phase multiple times and adjest area costs heuristically.

## How to Measure Area?

## Area-flow ("Effective Area")


## WireMap: mapping for improved routability
* Fewev pin-to-pin connections should make the design easier to place and route
	* Could we come up with a mapping algorithm to minimize the total # of connections in a design?
* Consider *edge-flow* for cut ranking
	* edge-flow (cut) = [cut size + **SIGMA** edge-flow ( fanin )] / no. of fanouts
