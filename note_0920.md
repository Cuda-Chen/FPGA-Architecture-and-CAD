# Programming Technologies and Logic Element Design

## Logic Cell
* FPGA's LE (Locig Element)
	* SRAM-based(lookup table based)
	* MUX-based
* CPLD's LE
	* Programmable array logic (PAL) based

## Lookup-Up Table
* Combinatorial logic is stored in look-up tables (LUTs) 
	* Capacity is limited by the number of inputs, **not by the
complexity**

## Use SRAM for LUT
* What configuration will get f = x1' x2+x1x2 '?
* Ans.
x1 x2 | f
----------
0  0  | 0
0  1  | 1
1  0  | 1
1  1  | 0
0110

## SRAM (LUT)-Based Logic Cell
* configuration bit

## Evaluation of SRAM-based LUT
* k-input LUT can handle all functions of <= k inputs.
* SRAM is larget than static gate equivalent of function.
* Burns power at idle (leakage power).
* Shutdown not practical since power must be maintained to retain configuration.

## Static CMOS gate vs. LUT
* 2-NAND gates: 4 transistors
	* 2 pmos + 2 nmos

* Number of transistors:
	* NAND/NOR gate has 2n transistors.
	* 4-input LUT has 80 transistors in SRAM, 96 in MUX.
* Delay:
	* 4-input NAND gate has 9\tau delay.
	* SRAM decoding has 21\tau delay.
* Power:
	* Shutdown of static CMOS logic can reduce leakage power.
	* Shutdown of SRAM not practical since power must be
	  maintained to retain configuration.

## MUX-based Logic Cell
* Consists of a few MUXs **and simple logic gates.**
* A 2^k to 1 MUX cna implement any function of up to **k+1** inputs.
* **read this part carefully**
