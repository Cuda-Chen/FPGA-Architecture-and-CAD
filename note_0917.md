# Comparison of IC Implementation Technologies

## How can we shorten the time from design to a physical IC?

## Cell-Based Design

## Standard Cell-Based Design Example
* Use a lot of pre-built designs to shorten the design time.
* Cannot shorten the **manufacture time**. 

## How about half-made chips?
* remind the T-shirt example last time

## Mask Programmable Gate-Array 
* MPGA
* MPGA companies offer half-processed wafers that can be more
quickly turned into ICs according to specific costumer's need.
* transistors (device layers, or Front End of Line, FEOL)
* metal wires (metal layers, or Back End of Line, BEOL)
    * MPGA companies make metal wires for each costumer's need.
* Pros: cost saving, reduce manufacture time
* Cons: performance not as good as full-custom or
standard-cell-based ICs

## Structure ASIC

## Structure ASIC Example
* M'X' stands for 'metal "X" layer'

## Field Programmable Logic Device (FPLD)
* FPLD are already completely fabricated, tested, packaged.

## IC Economics

## Summary


# Classifiction and Evolution of Field Programmable Logic Devices

## Field-Programmable Gate Array (FPGA)

## How to make a chip that caon realize different circuits and configurable?
## What are the essential elements that make up any circuit?

## What do you exect within a FPLD?
* contain flip-flops/latches

## Types of Field-Programmable Devices
* SPLD
* CPLD
* FPGA

## Programmable Logic Array (PLA)
* An SPLD.
* Based on ieda that logic functions can be realized in sum-of-products form.
    * K-map

## PLA Structure
* What are the equations for F~1~ and F~2~?
* Could the PLA implement the functions without the XOR gates?
* f XOR 0 = f
* f XOR 1 = $\bar{f}$

## Programmable Array Logic (PAL)
* A programmable array f NAD gates feeding a fixed array of OR gates.

## Function Implementation by PAL
* What are the equations for F1 through F4?
    * F1 = $\bar{A}\bar{B} + \bar{C}$
    * F2 = $\bar{A}B\bar{C} + AC + AB$

## PAL and PLA Comparison
* Both are useful for implementing small digital circuits, typically <= 32 combined inputs and outputs.
    * Large curcuit not only not feasible but also irritating.

## How to get larger capacity?

## Complex Programmable Logic Device (CPLD)
* Combines multiple PAL-like blocks with programmable interconnect network.
* Provides mus larget capacity than SPLDs.

## Field-Programmable Gate Array (FPGA)
* Classic FPGA consists of an *array of programmable logic blocks* surrounded by programmable interconnect.

## SRAM-Based FPGA
