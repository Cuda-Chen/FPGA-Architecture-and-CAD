# Comparison of IC Implementation Technologies

## How can we shorten the time from design to a physical IC?

## Cell-Based Design

## Standard Cell-Based Design Example
* Use a lot of pre-built designs to shorten the design time.
* Cannot shorten the **manufacture time**. 

## How about half-made chips?
* remind the T-shirt example last time

## Mask Programmable Gate-Array 
* MPGA
* MPGA companies offer half-processed wafers that can be more
quickly turned into ICs according to specific costumer's need.
* transistors (device layers, or Front End of Line, FEOL)
* metal wires (metal layers, or Back End of Line, BEOL)
    * MPGA companies make metal wires for each costumer's need.
* Pros: cost saving, reduce manufacture time
* Cons: performance not as good as full-custom or
standard-cell-based ICs

## Structure ASIC

## Structure ASIC Example
* M'X' stands for 'metal "X" layer'

## Field Programmable Logic Device (FPLD)
* FPLD are already completely fabricated, tested, packaged.

## IC Economics

## Cost vs Design Volume Example

# Classifiction and Evolution of Field Programmable Logic Devices

## Field-Programmable Gate Array (FPGA)

## How to make a chip that caon realize different circuits and configurable?
## What are the essential elements that make up any circuit?

## What do you exect within a FPLD?
* contain flip-flops/latches

## Types of Field-Programmable Devices
* SPLD
* CPLD
* FPGA

## Programmable Logic Array (PLA)
* An SPLD.
* Based on ieda that logic functions can be realized in sum-of-products form.
    * K-map

## PLA Structure
* What are the equations for F~1~ and F~2~?
* Could the PLA implement the functions without the XOR gates?
* f XOR 0 = f
* f XOR 1 = $$\bar{f}$$

## Programmable Array Logic (PAL)
* A programmable array f NAD gates feeding a fixed array of OR gates.

## Function Implementation by PAL
* What are the equations for F1 through F4?
    * F1 = $$\bar{A}\bar{B} + \bar{C}$$
    * F2 = $$\bar{A}B\bar{C} + AC + AB$$

## PAL and PLA Comparison
* Both are useful for implementing small digital circuits, typically <= 32 combined inputs and outputs.
    * Large curcuit not only not feasible but also irritating.

## How to get larger capacity?

## Complex Programmable Logic Device (CPLD)
* Combines multiple PAL-like blocks with programmable interconnect network.
* Provides mus larget capacity than SPLDs.

## Field-Programmable Gate Array (FPGA)
* Classic FPGA consists of an *array of programmable logic blocks* surrounded by programmable interconnect.

## SRAM-Based FPGA
* look-up table (LUT)
    * SRAM + some inputs + some MUX

## Microprocessor vs Custome Chip (ASIC) vs FPGA

## Rapidly Increasing Logic Capacity
* Altera vs Xilinx

# Programming Technologies and Logic Element Design

## Programmable Switches
* should
    * consume as little chip area as possible
    * have low On resistance and cery high OFF resistance
    * contribute low parasitic capacitance
    * be easy to fabricate in a large number reliably
* Whine on is better???
    * SRAM-based
    * Antifuse-based
    * Flash-based

## SRAM-based Programmable Connection
* Use a SRM cell to control a pass transistor or MUX.
* Bit in SRM determines state of connection.

## Antifuse-based Programmable Connection
* Use antifuse as programmable switch.
* Antifuse -- the opposite of regular fuse i.e., open until a programming current is forces through it.
* Pros
    * save a lot of area
    * no problem run in harsh environment
* Cons
    * non-reprogrammable

## Flash-based Programmable Connection
* Use EEPROM transistor as programmable switch.
* An n-channel EEPROM switch is programmed (eletrons get trapped on floating gate) by
applying higher-than-opration voltages to the drain and the control gate.
* **NOTE: ANALYZE THE CIRCUIT SHEMETIC**
