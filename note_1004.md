# Circuit Design and Architecture Exploration of FPGAs

## Topics
* Circuit Design for FPGAs
* Logic Block Architecture Study
* Routing Architecture Study

## Bit-Selection for LUT
* FPGA's LUT uses a MUX for bit-selection.
* MUX presents smaller load to memory cells.
	* Allows smaller memory cells.

## Multiplexers in FPGA
* MUXes used inside LUTs and for routing (intra-block and inter-block).

## Multiplexer Design
* By static gates
* By pass transistors
* use complementary switches (to implement 2 to 1 MUX)
* Pass transistor MUX uses fewer transistors than fully complementary gates.
* Pass transistor is somewhat faster than complementary switch:
	* Equal-strength p-type is 2.5x n-type width.
	* Total resistance is 0.5x, total capacitance is 3.5x.
	* RC depay is 0.5 x 3.5 = 1.75 times n-type switch.

## Performance of Static Gate MUX
* Depay through *n*-input NAND is (*n* + 2) / 3 using logical effort computation.
* for *b*-bit MUX
	* lg *b* + 1 inputs at first level, so delay is (lg *b* + 3) / 3.
	* Delay at second level is (*b* + 2) / 3.
* Delay grows as *b*.

## Performance ot Tree-based Pass Transistor MUX
* Delay proportional to suqare of path length.
* Delay Grows as (lg b)^2.

## Encoded MUX vs Decoded MUX
* Tradeoff between transistor count and delay
