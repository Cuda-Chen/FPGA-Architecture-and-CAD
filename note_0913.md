* New Era for FPGAs

2.5D FPGAs
* first commerical 2.5D IC
    * Xilinx Virtex-7 2000T
        * 4 dies
        * die-to-die connection through interposer-based 2.5D techonology
        * 6.8 billion transistors (~ 20 million ASIC gates)
    * Interposer-based inter-die connection
        * normal 2D IC has no silicon interposer
        * die and interposer are different wafer
        * can save more money (the larger the die, the more defect ratio)
    * intel stratix 10
        * use embedded multi-die interconnect bridge (EMID) to connect two adjacent dies
    * Silicon-bridge based connection
        * just little piece of silicon-bridge to do inter connection
Hybrid CPU-FPGA Device
* Hybrid Xeon CPU-Arria 1- FPGA chip

COMPARISON OF IC IMPLEMENTATION TECHNOLOGIES
Outline

Introduction to Integrated Circuits

IC Implementation Options

Full-Custom Layout Example
* can do anything you like
* time-consuming

Cell-Based Design
* some conpanies design IPs in order to sell to other conpanies

Standard Cell-Based Design Example

Standard-Cell-Based Design
* recude the risk compared to full-custom ICs


SIMPLE IC LESSON OF IMPLEMENTATION (OMITTED)
Important Consideration
* Profit
    * Market
    * Competitors
    * Cost per IC
* Risk
    * setup const
    * inventory cost
    * ...

how can we shorten the time to realize a product?

House Construction Analogy
* Fully Customized
* "Cell" Based

How about starting from a half-made product?

T-Shirt Business Model
* Blank M-size shirt
    * Customer 1's need
    * Customer 2's need

Can it be faster still?
