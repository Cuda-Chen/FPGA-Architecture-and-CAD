## Dynamic Programming
* when an optimization problem exhibits optimal substructures compute optimal solutions for subproblems
systematically, store and read the solution of the subproblems in the process

## Heuristic for General Network Mapping
* Partition a network into trees
	* Cut the network t all multiple fanout points
* Optimaly cover each tree
* Piece the tree-covers into a cover for the subject graph

## FlowMap: delay-optimal mapping for DAG
* Guarantee *depth-optimal* mappings for general DAGs.
* Automatically consider *duplication* for depth minimization(i.e., a node may be covered more than once).
* Use *network flow*.
