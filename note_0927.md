## Idea behind each Logic Cell Type
* SRAM-based
	* Use SRAM to store the truth table of a function
* MUX-based
	* Use MUX as function generator
* PAL-based
	* Use a sum of product approach to impelement function

## SRAM-based FPGAs
* Advantages
	* Reprogrammable
	* Dynamically reconfigurable
	* Uses standard processes
* Disadvantages
	* Higher static power dissipation than antifuse and flash
		* and shutdown is not pratical
	* Require loading from external device at power up
	* Possible to steal, disrupt configuration bits.

## Antifuse-based FPGAs
* Advantages
	* Non-volatile
	* Permanent
	* Lower static power consumption 
		* and shutdown is OK
	* Design security
* Disadvantages
	* Non-reprogrammable
	* Require more than standard processes

## Flash-based FPGAs
* Advantages
	* Non-volatile
	* Lower static power consumption
		* and shutdown is OK
	* Design security
	* Reprogrammable
* Disadvantages
	* Require more than standard processes
* **REMARK**: Hybrid "flash-SRAM" FPGAs simply combine flash-based storage (hold configuration pattern) and SRAM-based logic structure on one chip.

# Routing Architecture Design Basics

## Topics
* Tradeoffs: area, routability, performance
* Architecture
	* Segmented wiring
	* Switch boxes
	* Connection boxes

## Importance of Routing Architecture
* Engineers found that 60% logic utilization was good, 70% great, and 80% a practical impossibility. **Why?**
	* **Routing** is the **bottleneck**
* Competing for die area
	* Routing resources VS Logic resources

## Interconnect strategies for FPGA
* Observation:
	* Some nets are short, some are long
* Solution:
	* Provide different typre of wires:
		* Short wires: local LE connections.
		* Global wires: long-distance, buffered communication.
		* Special wires: clocks, etc.

## Paths in Programmable Interconnect
* How to make connection fomr LE to channel?
* HOw to make connection between channels?

## Interconnect Richness
* Whthin a channel:
	* How many wires?
	* Length of segments?
	* Number of connections from LE to channel?
* Between channels:
	* Number of connections between channels?
	* Channel structure?
* GRAPH
	* connection box
	* switch box
	* channel

* # stations
	* More stations?
	* Less stations?
