# Routing Architecture Design Basics

## Switch Box Implementation
* Each switch has 5 transistors.
* Each switch box has six switches.

## Connections from LE to Channel: 
Connection Box Design
* The switch number (one switch) of connection box is just for example.

## Drawbacks of Programmable Interconnect
* Switches add delay.
* Transistor off-state is worse in advanced technologies.
	* You can however use process technology to improve this.
* FPGA interconnect has extra length -> added capacitance.
	* also add delay
* Some wires will not be utilized.

# Commecrical Examples (Part 1): Xilinx SRAM-based FPGAs

## SRAM Usage
* 'M' for SRAM bit

## Slice Structure

## Multipurpose LUT

## Fast Carry Logic
* Each CLB contains separate logic and routing for the fast generation of sum & carry signals
	* Increases efficiency and performance of adders, subtractors, accumulators, comparators, and counters

## Carry and Arithmetic Logic
* 1 full adder need **2 lookup table** 

## MUXes in CLB
* THe MUXes increase the flexibility of a CLB
	* Output of MUX F5 can be any function of **<= 5 variables** or a **restricted** class of functions of **up to 9 variables**.
	* Output of MUX F6 can be any function of **<= 6 variables** or a **restricted** class of functions of **up to 19 variables**.
	* f(a, b, c, d, e) = a * f(1, b, c, d, e) + bar{a} * f(0, b, c, d, e)

## CLB Outputs
* E.g. A slice in Spartan-3
	* 4 outpus per slice
		* 2 registered, 2 non-registered
	* 2 BUFTs associated with each CLB
		* accessible by all 16 CLB outputs

## Some Changes in Spartan-6
* 3 Types of slices
	* SLICEM: full slice (25%)
		* LUT can be used ofr logic and memory/SRL
		* Has wide MUX and carry chain
	* SLICEL: Logic and arithmetic only (25%)
		* LUT cna only be used for logic
		* Has wide MUX and carry chain
	* SLICEX: Logic only (50%)
		
* New LUT structure
* **This page will be added in new version of the presentation**

## Interconnect
* Types of interconnect
	* logal
	* general-purpose
	* dedicated
	* global routing network (for clock and other very high fanout signals)

## General-Purpose Interconnect
* Genral routing matrix (GRM) connects horizontal/vertical channels and CLBs.
* Single-length lines connect adjacent GRMs.
* Hex lines connect GRM to GRMs siz blocks away.
* Buffered longlines span the chip.
* GRM is called switch box traditionally.

## Three-State Bus
* Dedicated resources for horizontal on-chip busses

## Clock distribution
* Use global routing resources
* Clock
	* synchronization (synchronize the operations of the flip-flops)

## I/O Block
* IOB (I/O Block) provides interface between the package pins and CLBs
* Support a variety of IO standards
* Each IOB can work as uni- ro bi-directional I/O
* Outputs can be forced into High Impedance
* Inputs and outputs can be registered
	* advised for high-performance I/O
* Inputs can be delayed

## I/O Block Diagram
* Can be configured to support different signaling standards
* ESD
	* static electricity protection

# Commercial Examples (part 2): Actel Antifuse-based, Flash-based FPGAs

## Topics
* Antifuse-based FPGA
	* Actel SX-A and Axcelerator (AX) families
* Flash-based FPGA
	* Actel ProASIC3 and IGLOO families

## Actel SX-A and AX Overview
* Antifuse-based FPGA
* Metal-tometal programmable antifuses
* Mux-based logic elements

## SX-A Logic Element
* Mix two types of logic modules
	* Combinational cell (C-cell)
		* can impement more than 4000 different functions of <= 5 inputs.
	* Register cell (R-cell)
		* contains a flip-flop

## Clusters and Superclusters (1/2)
* C/R cells organied into clusters
	* Type 1 cluster: CRC
	* Type 2 clusterL CRR
* Clusters grouped into superclusters
	* Type 1 : two type 1 clusters
	* Type 2: one type 1, one type 2
	* Majority is Type 1 superclusters

## SX-A Routing 
* Programmable antifuses between the top two metal layers
	* to save cost (each metal layer need extra cost to produce)

## Axcelerator (AX) family
* Successor of SX-A

## SuperCluster in AX Architecture
* Cluster = CCR + 2 transmit buffers + 2 receive buffers
* SuperCluster = 2 clusters + ad additional buffer

## ProASIC3 and IGLOO Overview
* Charge Pumps
	* To program/erase an EEPROM switch
* ISP AES Decryption
	* AES: Advanced Encryption Standard
	* for IP security protection

## Flash-based Switch
* Each switch has two transistors sharing the floating gate.
* One transistor as programming device and the other as switching device.

## Logic Cell (2/2)
* Each logic cell can be configured as 
	* any 3-input function
	* latch
	* D-flip-flop with or without enable
